__VueFront__ is a <a href="//vuejs.org">VueJS powered</a> CMS agnostic SPA & PWA frontend for your old-fashioned Blog and E-commerce site. 

__OpenCart__ - Open-source eCommerce platform built with MVC pattern.

__CMS Connect App__ - adds the connection between the OpenCart CMS and VueFront Web App via a GraphQL API.

## DEMO

[VueFront on OpenCart](https://opencart.vuefront.com/)

## OpenCart Versions
This repo stores the codebase for the CMS Connect App for OpenCart. Because of OpenCart's versioning, the branches are structured as follows 

| Repo Branch | OpenCart Versions  |
|--------|-------------|
| [master](https://github.com/vuefront/opencart) | 2.x-3.x     |
| [1.5x](https://github.com/vuefront/opencart/tree/1.5x)   | 1.5.x       |

### OpenCart Blog 
Since OpenCart does not have a built-in Blog, we use the [Blog / News](https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&extension_id=2419) by florinsith or [Blog Manager](https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&extension_id=4552) by qahar (disabled at this moment)

If you have another blog module that you would like us to integrate into VueFront CMS connect, please let us know via [issues tab](/issues/) and if your request gains interest we will add it for free. 

## How to install?

### Install via FTP
