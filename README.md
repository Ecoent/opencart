## OpenCart Versions
This repo stores the codebase for the CMS Connect App for OpenCart for version 1.5.x. Because of OpenCart's versioning, the branches are structured as follows 

| Repo Branch | OpenCart Versions  |
|--------|-------------|
| master | 2.x-3.x     |
| 1.5x   | 1.5.x       |

### OpenCart Blog 
Since OpenCart does not have a built-in Blog, we use the [Blog / News](https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&extension_id=2419) by florinsith or [Blog Manager](https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&extension_id=4552) by qahar (disabled at this moment)
