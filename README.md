## About this repo
This repo holds the codebase for the CMS Connect App for OpenCart. Because of OpenCarts versioning, the current `master` branch keeps the code for the module compatible with OpenCart version 2.x and 3.x 

For the older versions of OpenCart, use other branchers (1.5.x) 

### OpenCart Blog Module
Since OpenCart does not have a built-in Blog, we use the [Free Blog Module](https://github.com/Dreamvention/2_d_blog_module) by Dreamvention.
